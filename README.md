Using Jenkins
Build a pipeline job with Docker to build this repo https://github.com/Rosalita/GoViolin
The pipeline should be able to build the code using docker and reports if any errors happened in the build.The output of the build step should be a docker image pushed to dockerhub or any docker repo you want.
Also as a plus create kubernetes manifests to deploy the app using them on kubernetes (you can use minikube to test)
